I’ve watched stars being born in fiery bursts of light, and I’ve witnessed the eerie glow of black holes as they devour everything in their path. Every day brings something new, something extraordinary.

The sight of billions of stars swirling together, their light intertwining like a cosmic dance, left me speechless. It’s moments like these that remind me why I keep going.</p>
