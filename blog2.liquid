<p>If you’re reading this, it means my logs have found their way back to civilization. I hope they inspire you to look up at the stars and wonder what’s out there. The universe is vast, but it’s not infinite. There are edges to explore, mysteries to unravel, and wonders to behold.

And if you ever feel the call to venture into the unknown, don’t hesitate. The journey will be long, and the challenges will be great, but the rewards are beyond measure. Just remember: you’re never truly alone. Even in the farthest reaches of space, you’re part of something bigger—a universe that’s alive with possibility.</p>
